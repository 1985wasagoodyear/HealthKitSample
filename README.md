# HealthKitSample

A start of a pedometer application.

This application:
~~1. Detects user motion using `CoreMotion`~~
~~2. On motion, queries `HealthKit` for the amount of steps taken today~~
1. Tracks motion using the built-in pedometer in `CMPedometer`, within `CoreMotion`.
2. ???
3. Updates that steps value on the UI.


# TODO

* ~~May want to explore using `CMPedometer`?~~
